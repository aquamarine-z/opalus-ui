title: Add Opalus UI
---

To add Opalus UI Library to your Shadcn UI config,you should do the following steps:

## 1.Init the shadcn config file
```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest init
```
This will create a `components.json` file in the root of your project.
## 2.Add Opalus UI to the shadcn config file
Open the components.json file and add the following code.
```json
"registries": {
    "@opalus-ui": "https://opalus-ui.vercel.app/r/{name}.json"
  }
```

## 3.Install Opalus UI components
You can now install Opalus UI components using the shadcn CLI. For example, to install the `modal` component, run the following command:
```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add @opalus-ui/modal
```

## 4.For users in China Mainland
If you are in China Mainland, you may want to use the following registry link instead:
```json
{
  "registries": {
    "@opalus-ui": "https://opalus-ui.miyuzu.top/r/{name}"
  }
}
```
However, it is also sometime unreliable when you are in China Mainland.It is recommended to use a VPN for better access to the original registry.
